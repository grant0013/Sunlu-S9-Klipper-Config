# Klipper Config for Sunlu S9 Plus with SKR Mini E3 v3

![Sunlu S9 Plus](https://placehold.co/800x300/1e293b/ffffff?text=Sunlu%20S9%2B%20with%20Klipper)

Welcome! This repository contains a refined and optimized Klipper configuration for the **Sunlu S9 Plus** 3D printer, specifically upgraded with a **BigTreeTech SKR Mini E3 v3** mainboard.

The goal of this project is to create a robust, high-performance, and community-driven configuration that helps users get the most out of this large-format printer.

## ‚≠ê Key Features

This configuration has been carefully tuned and includes several enhancements over a basic setup:

* **üöÄ Performance Tuned:** Settings are geared towards high-quality, high-speed printing with a starting acceleration of 5000 mm/s¬≤.
* **„Ä∞Ô∏è Input Shaper Ready:** The config includes the necessary `[adxl345]` section. Just run the resonance tests to unlock faster, ghost-free printing.
* **üåê Optimized Bed Mesh:** A "Balanced" 7x7 bicubic bed mesh is configured to provide excellent first-layer accuracy across the large 310x310mm bed without taking excessive time.
* **ü§ñ Smart Macros:** Includes robust `START_PRINT` and `END_PRINT` macros that streamline the printing process. The start macro heats the bed first, probes for the mesh, and then heats the nozzle to prevent oozing.
* **üõ°Ô∏è Safe & Reliable:** Implements virtual Z-endstop using the probe for higher accuracy and reliability. Stepper motor currents have been adjusted for cooler, quieter operation without sacrificing torque.
* **üßπ Clean & Commented:** The configuration is heavily commented and organized into logical sections, making it easy to read, understand, and modify.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

**‚ùóÔ∏è IMPORTANT:** This is not a drop-in file. You **must** perform your own calibrations. Every printer is slightly different.

1.  **Download the Files:** Download the `printer.cfg` and `Macro.cfg` from this repository.
2.  **Verify Your MCU ID:** This is the most common point of failure. SSH into your Raspberry Pi and run `ls /dev/serial/by-id/*`. Copy the result and replace the `serial:` value in the `[mcu]` section of `printer.cfg`.
3.  **Initial Startup & Checks:** After uploading the config, restart Klipper. Ensure there are no errors and that all heaters and fans respond correctly.
4.  **Critical Calibrations:** You **must** run the following calibrations for your specific machine:
    * **PID Tuning:** Run `PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=210` and `PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=60`.
    * **Probe Z-Offset:** This is crucial for your first layer. Run `PROBE_CALIBRATE` and follow the steps carefully.
    * **Input Shaper:** Follow the official Klipper documentation to run the resonance tests using the ADXL345. Update the `[input_shaper]` section with your results.
    * **Pressure Advance:** Once Input Shaper is tuned, calibrate Pressure Advance for your specific filament.
    * **Extruder E-Steps:** Calibrate the `rotation_distance` in the `[extruder]` section.
